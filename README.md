# CSS Slideshows
Revolving image galleries using CSS animations. [https://lab.tylergaw.com/css-slideshows](https://lab.tylergaw.com/css-slideshows)

## What?
It's really just some trickery. Each image or slide of the gallery has a CSS animation applied to it. The animations are staggered in a way that each image is off screen in some way while the images before it are off screen.
